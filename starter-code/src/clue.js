// ITERATION 2
/* 
At the beginning of the game, players shuffle each of the card 
stacks to create a combination of suspect, weapon and room. This will 
be the mystery to solve.

Random selector
Declare a function named selectRandom to randomly select one element 
from a card stack. The function should expect an array as an argument, 
and should return a random element from the array.

Create the mystery
Declare a function named pickMystery that takes no arguments and 
returns an object with three properties, suspect, weapon and room, 
each holding as a value a card of that specific type. You can get a 
random card of each type by calling selectRandom on each card stack.
